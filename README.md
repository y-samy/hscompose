# XCompose For Windows (but really stupid)

This combination of AutoHotKey scripts acts as a crude remake of XCompose for Windows.

How to run:
> Requires [AutoHotKey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

- Download the latest version of this script from [Releases](https://github.com/y-samy/stupid-wincompose/).
- Unzip the folder, copy the folder containing both `.ahk` files into your `Documents\AutoHotKey` folder.
- Run `composekey.ahk`.

How to use:
- Press the [Menu Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key) on your keyboard.
- Type in your abbreviation or press [Esc] to stop.
- Your abbreviation is immediately replaced with the text intended.

To modify, edit each script and read the instructions inside them.

How to run at startup:
- Go to the location where you keep both files.
- Right-click `composekey.ahk`, click "More Options" if on Windows 11, then click "Create Shortcut".
- Name this shortcut file whatever you want.
- Right-click the shortcut file then copy it.
- Hit the `Windows` + `R` keys and type `shell:startup`. In that folder, right click and paste your shortcut. 

Tested with Windows 11.
